# City-of-Angels-Crime-Investigation
#### Analyzing Los Angeles Crime Rate Data to Gain Insights to Submit to the City
**Introduction**
Los Angeles is no stranger to crime. Can historical data be used to help reduce crime? This projects examines LA crime rate trends from January 1st, 2020, through December 6th, 2023. The city's crime prevention unit has asked their Data Analyst to examine crime rate trends in Los Angeles. The goal is to derive insights as to yearly, monthly, and daily trends. With the answers acquired from this analysis, the city could propose police force budgeting to increase policing depending on when and where crimes are most likely to occur. Crime prevention programs and local communities can advise citizens as to which types of crimes are most likely to occur thus helping citizens take better precautions.

**Questions to Answer**
The following questions will be addressed in the following analysis with a focus being on trends, types  of crimes, and locations: 
1. What has been the yearly trend in crime, how might this vary by region or type of crime?
2. Which months have the highest incidents of crime, how may this vary by region or type of crime?
3. Which day of the week are crimes most likely to occur and how might this vary by region or type of crime?
4. What time of day are crimes most likely to occur and how might this vary by region or type of crime? 

**Importance:** 
Knowing when crimes are most likely to occur and in which areas can help the city to better plan policing efforts and or budgeting. 
When when specific crimes are more likely to occur can help citizens take crime preventive actions to help deter crime.
Local communities can also use the insights to create programs and or alert citizens on which crimes are most present in their area or which time of day they are most likely to occur.
